# drawing-with-a-camera
An affordable, accurate and available-for-all substitute for graphic design tools and tablets which can typically cost up to thousands of dollars.

# About the demo:
In the demo video, you can see more than one window open on the screen. The "main" window is the white one with the color palette on its left side. All the other windows are showed for debugging/showing behind the scenes purposes.
The first window that pops up shows what the camera sees and the user starts sampling his pen color (green in this case) by a single simple click and then he proceeds to pick the 4 corners on his paper to use as a canvas. You can notice the small circles detecting the head of the pen and its shadow.
After that, the white canvas pops up with all the colors and features (explained in "all you need to know" file) and so the user can start drawing freely.
